## React Native Udemy Course

For now, I've completed up to `section 3` of the course. I've done the necessary exercises also. Below are the outputs of my various screens.

#### 1. Home Screen

This screen is not found in the course, but is an additional screen added by me to easily have access to the various sections and exercises as I journey through the course. This screen takes into consideration `navigation` between the various screens.
